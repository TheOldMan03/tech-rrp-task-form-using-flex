# Make a signup/login form

## We want you to learn flex in css. The form must be styled using flex.

Some example input fields for signup part will be
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Password x2 one for confirmation
- agree to terms and conditions tickbox
- Signup button

For login
- email
- password
- Login button

Feel free to add more if necessary.

Also user should be able to switch between login and signup.

Design is up to you. You can take inspiration from any website. Maybe add some micro-animations and make it look good.
